### Welcome to the DND Stats Generator

This command-line program includes a dice roller which can perform multiple (pseudo-)random dice rolls of any "nDm" type, where n is the number of dice to be rolled and m represents the number of faces each dice contains.

To generate the 6 DnD ability scores, the program currently has two working methods: 3d6 and 4d6-drop-1.

After score generation, the program will then allow you to assign the scores to a character ability, then print you a list on the command line once complete.

After ability assignment, the program will offer to write out a summary to a file with a name of your choice (saved in program directory).

All character and general DnD behavior are based on the latest editions and expansions for the game.
