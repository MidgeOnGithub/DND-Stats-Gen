### Welcome to the DND Stats Generator

This command-line program includes a dice roller which can perform multiple (pseudo-)random dice rolls of any "nDm" type, where n is the number of dice to be rolled and m represents the number of faces each dice contains.

To generate the 6 DnD ability scorees, the program currently has two working methods: 3d6 and 4d6-drop-1.

After score generation, the program will then allow you to assign the scores to a character ability, then print you a list on the command line once complete.

All character and general DnD behavior are based on the latest editions and expansions for the game.

In the future, it will offer to write the character information out to a simple .txt file.
