### Welcome to the DND Stats Generator

This command-line program will eventually, if you want a "6 * 3d6" number generation, perform multiple (pseudo-)random dice rolls of any "nDm" type, where n is the number of dice to be rolled and m represents the number of faces each dice contains.

The program will then allow you to assign the 3d6 rolls to each of the main stats, print you a list on the command line once complete, and offer to write them out to a simple .txt file.
